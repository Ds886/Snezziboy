v0.21 
----

Bug Fixes:

- Fixed the TSC instruction so that the C register is updated regardless if M bit.
- Fixed the TDC instruction so that the C register is updated regardless if M bit.
- Fixed the RTL/RTS/RTI instructions so that it can properly return from the subroutine
  that had been JSL/JSR-ed from $xx:8000
- Made fixes in the memory map for games with no SRAM size, so that ROMs that try
  to detect for absence of SRAM (protection against copying) will get what they expect.
  (Bust-a-move makes it to the main screen, but the game itself is unplayable due to
  the use of HDMA)
- Made fixes to the $DB (modified STP instruction) to jump correctly. 
  (Tetris Attack now works)
- Fixed the PEI instruction; it was previously pushing $0000 always onto the stack
- Fixed BIT instruction to update the N/Z flags correctly when BIT-ing in a non-immediate mode.
  (Super Mario World fades correctly after each stage)
  (Megaman7's collision detection is now accurate)
- Fixed register $4016 for joypad auto-reading and latching
  (Donkey Kong Country now recognizes joypad input)
- Reworked SRAM reading and writing routines
  (Donkey Kong Country seems playable; some screens are remain garbled) 
- Fixed bug with VRAM writing
  (Darius Twin's in-game screen no longer garbles-up randomly)

Known Issues:

- Breath of Fire I keeps flickering, and runs very slowly.
- For some reason, sprites seem to be 'flickering' on many games.


v0.2 
----

Bug Fixes:

- Fixed the TXS instruction so that processor flags are not updated
- Fixed the IO for WRAM write at IO addresses $2180-3
  (Megaman7 sprites now appear)
- Incorporated SNES Advance's SBC/ADC accurate implementations
  (Super Mario World now works)
- Used a jump table to implement scanline skipping for $42 and $DB opcodes
- Fixed scanline skipping to proceed to the next immediate interrupt when NMI, V+H IRQ is enabled.
  (MegamanX, Megaman7 runs faster)
- Fixed 256 color background update (for mode 3)
  (Super Mario All-Stars title and menu selection now visible, 
  Super Mario Bros, The Lost Worlds subgames entirely playable with appropriate speed patch)
- Fixed VRAM allocation for modes 2 and above 
  (able to see blobs that have been dropped on the field)

Known Issues:

- VRAM writing sometime still screws up 
  (Kirby's avalanche: can be worked around by pressing L+R+start to go to the config, and exiting
  the config screen again)
