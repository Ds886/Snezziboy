----

Bug Fixes:

- Fixed vertical-sync so that games appear much smoother now.
- Fixed the TXS instruction so that processor flags are not updated
- Fixed the IO for WRAM write at IO addresses $2180-3
  (Megaman7 sprites now appear)
- Incorporated SNES Advance's SBC/ADC accurate implementations
  (Super Mario World now works)
- Used a jump table to implement scanline skipping for $42 and $DB opcodes
- Fixed scanline skipping to proceed to the next immediate interrupt when NMI, V+H IRQ is enabled.
  (MegamanX, Megaman7 runs faster)
- Fixed 256 color background update (for mode 3)
  (Super Mario All-Stars title and menu selection now visible, 
  Super Mario Bros, The Lost Worlds subgames seem playable with appropriate speed patch)

  (able to see blobs that have been dropped on the field)

Known Issues:

- VRAM writing sometime still screws up 
  (Kirby's avalanche: can be worked around by pressing L+R+start to go to the config, and exiting
  the config screen again)
